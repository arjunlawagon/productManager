# React + Vite - Product Management App

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules. The app demonstrates a basic product management system with features to manage products' names and quantities.

## Features

### Product Maintenance
- **Create** and **update** product name, quantity, etc.

### Product Listing
- Display a list of products showing their **name** and **quantity**.

### Extra Logic
1. **Quantity Management**:
    - Increase or decrease product quantity (minimum value of 0).

2. **Product Removal**:
    - A product can be removed from the list when its quantity reaches 0.

## Styling

The application uses **React Bootstrap** for basic styling, including buttons and alerts. You can choose to replace it with **Material UI** or **Tailwind CSS** if needed.

## React Hook Design Pattern

The application follows the **React Hook design pattern**, utilizing the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and side effects, respectively. The app is built without class components to provide a modern, functional approach to React development.
